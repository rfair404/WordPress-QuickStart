# Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This repository contains sample code for a quickstart WordPress application. The purpose of the application is to provide a reliable and thoroughly tested starting point for WordPress websites. It includes essential features such as user authentication, content management, and optional e-commerce capabilities.

The majority of the software dependencies will be managed using composer and npm, with a focus on using well-established libraries and frameworks to ensure maintainability and scalability.

## Coding Standards & Style

The project should adhere to strict coding standards and every file within the repository should be meticulously formatted to maintain standardization and readability.

### General Guidelines

- Write clean, readable, and well-documented code
- Follow established naming conventions for the language/framework
- Include meaningful comments for complex logic
- Prefer explicit over implicit code when it improves readability

### Code Quality

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Handle errors gracefully with appropriate error messages
- Validate inputs and sanitize outputs
- Follow security best practices

## Language & Framework Preferences

The project prefers to use PHP packages which are fully open source and require no third party licensing and maintain full compliance with WordPress's GPL license.

### [Language] Specific Guidelines

- Follows the WordPress VIP coding standards
- Use type hints/annotations where applicable

### Dependencies

## File Structure & Organization

- Follow established project structure
- Group related functionality together
- Use descriptive file and folder names
- Separate concerns appropriately

## Documentation

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Update README.md for significant changes
- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Include usage examples for complex features

## Testing

- Write tests for new features and bug fixes
- Maintain good test coverage
- Use descriptive test names
- Test edge cases and error conditions

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Profile before optimizing
- Consider memory usage and resource consumption
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms

## Security Guidelines

- Never commit sensitive information (API keys, passwords, etc.)
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure coding practices
- Follow authentication and authorization best practices

## Comments & Documentation Style

- Use clear, concise comments
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Keep comments up to date with code changes
- Use proper grammar and spelling

## Specific Preferences

<!-- Customize these based on your preferences -->

- Prefer explicit variable names over abbreviations
- Use consistent indentation (spaces/tabs)
- Maximum line length: [specify if needed]
- Prefer early returns to reduce nesting

## Tools & Environment

- Lando should be used for local development
- Github actions should be used for validating pull requests [List any specific tools, linters, formatters, or CI/CD requirements]
- A file type agnostic Linter should be used for formatting various file types, like markdown, JSON and Yml
- File type specific linters should be used for language specific file types like PHP and JavaScript
